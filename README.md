# Project Title: Bus Ticket Reservation System using Python OOP

## Project Description:
- As part of my studies/training in Python, I developed a Bus Ticket Reservation System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. 
- The project allows users to reserve bus tickets for a specified route and travel date. 
- The system includes classes for the bus, route, reservation, and payment.

## The Bus Ticket Reservation System includes the following features:

- Bus Class: This class includes the details of the bus, such as the bus number, capacity, and availability. It also includes methods to add new buses, remove buses, and view the bus schedule.

- Route Class: This class includes the details of the bus route, such as the source and destination cities, the travel time, and the fare. It also includes methods to add new routes and view the route schedule.

- Reservation Class: This class includes the details of the reservation, such as the bus, the route, the passenger name, and the travel date. It also includes methods to make a new reservation, cancel a reservation, and view the reservation details.

- Payment Class: This class includes the details of the payment, such as the payment amount, payment date, and payment method. It also includes methods to process the payment and generate a payment receipt.

I developed this project using Python OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation. I also used Python libraries such as datetime to track reservation and payment dates. I gained experience in software design and development, testing, and debugging. Overall, this project helped me strengthen my Python programming skills and understanding of OOP concepts.
